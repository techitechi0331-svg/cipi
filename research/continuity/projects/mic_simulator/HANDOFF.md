## Current position
- Phase: **BLOCKED**
- Resume mode: **BLOCKED**
- Can autonomously resume: **false**
- Recommended action: WAIT_OR_STEAL_OTHER_PROJECT

## READY
- none

## BLOCKED
- VIRTUAL-GUITAR-MIC-INTEGRATION-001 — BLOCKED_DEPENDENCY

## Human gates
- VIRTUAL-GUITAR-MIC-INTEGRATION-001: FINAL_MIC_INTEGRATION_ADOPTION, REAL_AUDIO_AB

## Must not repeat
- none

## Important decision refs
- none

## Unresolved questions
- After the Cabinet/Speaker output boundary and the independent Mic Simulator contract, validation, and CIPI Integration Candidate have converged, can Virtual Guitar integrate the external Mic Engine through a versioned optional boundary without coupling to its internals or regressing existing guitar behavior?

## Re-entry rule
Validate schema, source-state digest, product ref, Human Gates, and READY/BLOCKED state before acting.
Do not infer PROMOTE, REJECT, product adoption, listening results, or release approval from this projection.
